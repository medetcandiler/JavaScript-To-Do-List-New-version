## ABOUT ME 

Hello Everyone. Let me briefly introduce myself to you. First of all I am so glad to see you are looking at my project. My name is Medetcan Diler. I am 26 years old. I am a fresh graduated mechanical engineer. After my graduation I worked as an engineer in the field somewhere in the region of 5 months. After That I decided to research on different careers specifically those that include web development. Because I have always been interested in coding, software, computer and its components. After extensive research, I grew more interest towards coding and I felt driven and motivated to become a genuinely brilliant frontend web developer. Before I finish I would like to add that my education background that engineering has taught me how to work in an higly orginised and systematic way which allows me to learn in an effective way. What I mean by saying that is my enginnering background has been making great contrubutions to my learning process. I hope I did not bore you with my brief introduction.
